A desktop app that can distinguish between ‘walking’ and‘jumping’ with a reasonable accuracy, using the data collected from the accelerometers of a smartphone. The project involves building a small and simple desktop application that accepts accelerometer data (x, y, and z axes) in CSV format, and writes the outputs into a separate CSV file. The outputCSV file contains the labels (‘walking’ or ‘jumping’) for the corresponding input data. For classification purposes, the system will use a simple classifier, i.e., logistic regression.
